### Synopsis
One of the main objectives of my research was to analyze the factors contributing to changes in coastal dunes. To achieve this goal: <br>
<ul>
  <li>I applied a one-way ANOVA test on 22 morphological, oceanographic, meteorological and anthropogenic factors to identify which factors have significant variations among four coastal dune classes.</li> <br>
  <li>Furthermore, I conducted a Jackknife Test with XGBoost machine learning model to determine the sensitive factors which have the highest contributions in classifying coastal dunes.</li>
</ul>

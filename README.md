I applied a one-way ANOVA test on 22 morphological, oceanographic, meteorological and anthropogenic factors to identify which factors have significant variations among four coastal dune classes. Next, I applied a Jackknife Test with XGBoost machine learning model to determine the sensitive factors which have the highest contributions in classifying coastal dunes.
